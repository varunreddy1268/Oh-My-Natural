## Problem Statement

The mission of this project is to safeguard soil fertility by promoting sustainable farming practices. This includes treating crop diseases organically and cultivating crops that are best suited for specific soil types to prevent degradation.


## Description of Problem

## Motivation ðŸ’ª

- Farming is a cornerstone of a country's economic growth, especially in nations like India where a significant portion of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods.

- Incorporating technologies like Machine Learning and Deep Learning into agriculture can greatly assist farmers in maximizing their yields.

- In this project, we've developed a website with three key applications: Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation, and Plant disease prediction.

## Applications

### Crop Recommendation

Users can input soil data, and the application will recommend which crop is best suited for their specific conditions.

### Fertilizer Recommendation

Users provide soil data and specify the crop they're growing. The application will then suggest necessary improvements based on nutrient levels.

### Plant Disease Prediction

Users can upload a photograph of an afflicted plant leaf, and the program will diagnose the condition, offer background information, and suggest treatment options.
