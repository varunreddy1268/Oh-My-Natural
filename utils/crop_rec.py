    'rice': """ <b>Steps To Grow</b>: 
        <br/> 1 - Planting Seeds: Place the rice seeds all over the ground, in the course of the fall or spring season. Clear out weed plants, prepare the beds, and smoothen out the soil. If you are using buckets, fill them with a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) of damp soil.
        <br/>
        <br/> 2 - Flooding and Initial water supply: Fill up the buckets or the garden area with at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water. But, this is just a traditional recommendation. Many individuals claim keeping the soil constantly soaked is enough – it doesn’t need to be flooded completely. 
        <br/>
        <br/> 3 - Keeping Check on Water Supply: Keep check of the water height in the planting area, ensuring that the soil is constantly wet. If you’d prefer, uphold 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water level for the rice to develop.
        <br/>
        <br/> 4 - Replanting the Rice plants: Thin, or space out, the rice seeds to prevent crowding. For best results, thin out the seedlings no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart in rows that range between 9 to 12 inches (22.9 to 30.5 cm) apart. Allow the seeds to grow up to 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall, which takes on average of about one month.
        <br/>
        <br/> 5 - Waiting Time: Wait for the rice grains to mature. This will take almost 3 or 4 months; during this time, they can go up to 17 inches high. Allow for the water dry out or remove any extra water prior to removing the rice for harvesting.
        <br/>
        <br/> 6- Harvesting Time: Cut down the stems and allow them to dry. When the rice has turns gold (around 2 weeks or so after draining), they’re all set. Cut the stalks just below the heads where the rice grains are located. You’ll find small pockets over the stalk that are clearly the hulls of the rice.""",
        
       
    'maize': """ <b>Steps To Grow</b>:
        <br/>
        <br/> 1. Soil Preparation: The soil should be well-worked, loose, and well-drained with a pH of 5.8 to 6.8. Aged compost should be added to the planted bed two to three weeks before sowing. Aged compost can also be added to the planting area during autumn.
        <br/>
        <br/> 2. Planting Time: Since maize is a warm-season annual plant, it is best for it to be planted in soil with temperature that are above 60°F (15.5°C), two to three weeks after the last frost in spring.
        <br/>
        <br/> 3. Sowing: Start outdoors for best results. Sow seeds one inch (2.5 cm) deep a couple of weeks after the last frost. Space at about two to four inches (5 – 10 cm) apart in short, side-by-side rows to form a block of at least four rows, as opposed to single rows. This will aid in successful wind pollination.
        <br/>
        <br/> 5. Maize Plant Care: Maize grows fast in hot weather and needs an even supply of moisture to avoid wilting. Always keep the plants moist by watering regularly. Do not water overhead, especially when tassels began to appear; water hitting the tassels during the time of pollination can reduce the number of kernels on a cob.
        <br/>
        <br/> 6. Maize Harvest Season and Storage: Depending on the warmth of the weather and on the variety of corn, the harvest will normally be ready about 60 to 100 days after sowing. Corn is ready to be harvested once the ears turn dark green, kernels become plump and soft and the silks turn brown.""",
        
    'chickpea': """ <b>Steps To Grow</b>: 
        <br/>
        <br/>1. Planting Chickpeas: Plant chickpeas in full sun. Chickpeas will grow in partial shade but the yield will be reduced. Avoid planting chickpeas where green manures have just grown or in soil high in nitrogen; this will result in green leafy growth, not seed production.Add potassium and phosphorus to the soil.. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.
        <br/>
        <br/>2. Planting Time: Chickpea is a cool-season annual that requires 100 or so days to reach harvest. Chickpeas are frost tolerant but grow best where daytime temperatures range between 70 and 80ºF (21-26ºC) and where nighttime temperatures do not dip below 65ºF(18ºC).
        <br/>
        <br/>3. Planting and Spacing: Sow chickpeas 1½ to 2 inches (5cm) deep, spaced 3 to 6 inches (7-15cm) apart. Thin successful plants to 6 inches (15cm) apart; cutaway thinned plants at soil level with scissors so as not to disturb roots. Space rows 18 to 24 inches (45-61cm) apart.
                <br/>
        <br/>4. Water and Feeding Chick Peas: Keep chickpea planting beds evenly moist until chickpeas have pushed through the soil. Water regularly during flowering and pod formation. Avoid overhead watering which can cause flowers and pods to fall off.Mulch when the weather warms to conserve soil moisture. Add aged compost to planting beds in advance of planting.
        <br/>
        <br/>5. Chickpea Care: Avoid handling chickpeas when they are wet or covered with heavy dew; this may spread fungus spores. Keep planting beds weed-free but cultivate around chickpeas carefully so as not to disturb the plant’s shallow root system.
        <br/>
        <br/>6. Harvesting Chickpeas: Chickpeas will be ready for harvest about 100 days after planting. Chickpeas for fresh eating can be picked when pods are still immature and green; they can be eaten like snap beans.""",

        <br/>
        <br/>1. Soil Preparation: Beans grow well in nutrition-rich soil with good drainage. Mix garden compost with potting soil to prepare your soil for beans. Till the soil properly to break any clay-like structures. Beans are nitrogen-fixing plants, simply put, they can pull nitrogen from the air and make the soil more fertile. Just add compost to your soil and you’re good to move to the next phase of planting.
        <br/>
        <br/>2. Sowing the seeds: The bean seeds should be directly sown into the ground. It shouldn’t be transplanted or grown indoors initially as the roots of this plant are very delicate and can be easily damaged during the transplant process.
        <br/>
        <br/>3. Installing Trellis: Place the trellis in the exact spot you are planning to grow your beans. As the bean plant will mature, it will spiral around the trellis installed. Ensure that your trellis is installed deep into the ground to prevent it from falling and avoid any plant damage. 
        <br/>
        <br/>4. Planting: Plant the bean seeds directly into the soil about 9-12 inches away from each other. Dig a 1-inch deep hole, place the seed, and cover it with soil properly. To aid the germination process, water the seeds regularly for 3-4 days
        <br/>
        <br/>5. Care & Maintenance: After the planting stage, comes the caring stage. After the seeds start to sprout, add a layer of mulch. Use leaves, shredded plants as mulch material. Add a layer of fertilizers to your plants to promote growth. As beans are nitrogen-fixing plants, pick fertilizers that are rich in other nutrients like phosphorus and potassium.
        <br/>
        <br/>6. Harvesting: Once the pods begin to show the shape of the beans, they start drying out. Harvest the pods by snapping them from the top. Be careful while harvesting as you don’t want to damage the plant and prevent new pods from growing.

        <br/>1. Seed Research: While papaya plants are technically herbs, they are often mistaken for trees for a reason. Some varieties and individuals can reach 7.6 m (25ft.) in height, although you should check the source of your banana plant or local banana.
        <br/>
        <br/>2. Planting Time:Ideal daytime temperatures are between 26–30ºC (78–86ºF), with night temperatures no lower than 20ºC (67ºF). Acceptable temperatures are warm and very rarely reach lower than 14ºC (57ºF) or higher than 34ºC (93ºF). Bananas can take up to a year to produce fruit, so it's important to know what range of temperatures it will experience throughout the year.If the temperature falls below 14ºC (57ºF), your banana plants will simply stop growing.
        <br/>
        <br/>3. Choose a sunny, well-drained location: Lentils grow well in both open gardens and containers. The key is to provide the plant with plenty of full sunlight. It helps to plant them alongside low lying plants so that the lentils are not overshadowed. 
        <br/>
        <br/>4. Planting seeds: Plant seeds at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. If your soil is moist and in good condition, plant the seeds at a depth of 1 inch (2.5 cm). 
        <br/>
        <br/>5. Trellis for mature plants: Add a trellis for mature plants. Fully grown lentils can stand over 2.5 feet (76 cm) tall. If they droop, then their flowers and seed pods can break off or touch the ground. Add a low trellis to support them and wind the plants through the gaps. Or, secure them to bamboo supports with cotton string.
        <br/>
        <br/>6. Harvest Time: After 80 to 100 days after the planting time the plants off at the soil line when the bottom third of the pods begin to the sound and shaky when rattled.""",
