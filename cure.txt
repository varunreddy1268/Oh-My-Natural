:Apple___Cedar_apple_rust-Neem oil may also help to a lesser degree. This spray should be done around the time of tight cluster in apples (when leaves and buds are present, but before the blossoms open up).

The boards are placed at the height of the plants. Monitor all crops, not just tomato plants as the whitefly may have passed the virus onto another crop.
:Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus-Once a plant contracts the mosaic virus, the infected plant can then spread the virus to other plants and even affect an entire harvest if left untreated.
